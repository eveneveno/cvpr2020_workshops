## SUNDAY, JUNE 14TH
> ### Workshops 
#### [1. üçÉ DynaVis: The 2nd International Workshop on Dynamic Scene Reconstruction](https://dynavis.github.io/2020/) (9:00 AM-1:00 PM) 
* Reconstruction of general dynamic scenes is motivated by potential applications in film and broadcast production together with the ultimate goal of automatic understanding of real-world scenes from distributed camera networks. With recent advances in hardware and the advent of virtual and augmented reality, dynamic scene reconstruction is being applied to more complex scenes with applications in Entertainment, Games, Film, Creative Industries and AR/VR/MR. We welcome contributions to this workshop in the form of oral presentations and posters. Suggested topics include, but are not limited to: 
  <br>
  * Dynamic 3D reconstruction from single, stereo or multiple views
  * Learning-based methods in dynamic scene reconstruction and understanding
  * Multi-modal dynamic scene modelling (RGBD, LIDAR, 360 video, light fields)
  * 4D reconstruction and modelling
  * 3D/4D data acquisition, representation, compression and transmission
  * Scene analysis and understanding in 2D and 3D
  * Structure from motion, camera calibration and pose estimation
  * Digital humans: motion and performance capture, bodies, faces, hands
  * Geometry processing
  * Computational photography
  * Appearance and reflectance modelling
  * Scene modelling in the wild, moving cameras, handheld cameras
  * Applications of dynamic scene reconstruction (VR/AR, character animation, free-viewpoint video, relighting, medical imaging, creative content production, animal tracking, HCI, sports)

#### [4. Deep Declarative Networks](https://anucvml.github.io/ddn-cvprw2020/) (9:00 AM-5:00 PM)
* Conventional deep learning architectures involve composition of simple feedforward processing functions that are explicitly defined. Recently, researchers have been exploring deep learning models with implicitly defined components. To distinguish these from conventional deep learning models we call them deep declarative networks, borrowing nomenclature from the programming languages community ([Gould et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04866)). This workshop explores the advantages (and potential shortcomings) of declarative networks and their variants, bringing ideas developed in different contexts under the umbrella of deep declarative networks. We will discuss technical issues that need to be overcome in developing such models and applications of these models to computer vision problems that show benefit over conventional approaches. Topics include:
    <br>
    * Declarative end-to-end learnable processing nodes
    * Differentiable constrained and unconstrained (non-convex) optimization problems
    * Differentiable convex optimization problems
    * Imposing hard constraints in deep learning models
    * Back-propagation through physical models
    * Applications of the above to problems in computer vision such as differentiable rendering, differentiable 3d models, reinforcement learning, action recognition, meta-learning, etc

* Thus far, the vision community's attention has mostly focused on generative models of 2D images. However, in computer graphics, there has been a recent surge of activity in generative models of three-dimensional content: learnable models which can synthesize novel 3D objects, or even larger scenes composed of multiple objects. As the vision community turns from passive internet-images based vision toward more embodied vision tasks, these kinds of 3D generative models become increasingly important: as unsupervised feature learners, as training data synthesizers, as a platform to study 3D representations for 3D vision tasks, and as a way of equipping an embodied agent with a 3D `imagination' about the kinds of objects and scenes it might encounter.

#### [2. üçÉ Extreme classification in computer vision](http://manikvarma.org/events/CVPR2020/index.html)
* Extreme classification is a rapidly growing research area in computer vision focussing on multi-class and multi-label problems involving an extremely large number of labels (ranging from thousands to billions). Many applications of extreme classification have been found in diverse areas including recognizing faces, retail products and landmarks; image and video tagging; etc. Extreme classification reformulations have led to significant gains over traditional ranking and recommendation techniques for both machine learning and computer vision applications leading to their deployment in several popular products used by millions of people worldwide. This has come about due to recent key advances in modeling structural relations among labels, the development of sub-linear time algorithms for training and inference, the development of appropriate loss-functions which are unbiased with respect to missing labels and provide greater rewards for the accurate prediction of rare labels, etc. Extreme classification raises a number of interesting research questions including but not limited to:
    <br>
  * `Large-scale fine-grained` classification and embeddings
  * `Cross-modality` modeling of visual and label spaces
  * Distributed and parallel learning in extremely large output spaces
  * Learning from highly `imbalanced data`
  * Dealing with `tail labels` and learning from very few data points per label
  * `Zero shot learning` and extensible output spaces
  * `Transfer learning` and domain adaptation
  * `Modeling structural relations` among labels

#### [3. Image Matching: Local Features and Beyond](https://image-matching-workshop.github.io/)
* Traditional, keypoint-based formulations for image matching are still very competitive on tasks such as Structure from Motion (SfM), despite recent efforts on tackling pose estimation with dense networks. In practice, many state-of-the-art pipelines still rely on methods that stood the test of time, such as SIFT or RANSAC.
* In this workshop, we aim to encourage novel strategies for image matching that deviate from and advance traditional formulations, `with a focus on large-scale, wide-baseline matching for 3D reconstruction or pose estimation`. This can be achieved by applying new technologies to sparse feature matching, or doing away with keypoints and descriptors entirely.The workshop topics include (but are not limited to):
<br>
    * Reformulating keypoint extraction and matching pipelines with deep networks.
    * Applying geometric constraints into the training of (sparse or dense) deep networks.
    * Leveraging additional cues such as semantics.
    * Developing adversarial methods to deal with conditions where current methods fail (weather changes, day versus night, etc.).
    * Exploring attention mechanisms to match salient image regions.
    * Integrating differentiable components into 3D reconstruction frameworks.
    * Matching across different data modalities such as aerial versus ground.

#### [8. 5th International Workshop on Differential Geometry in Computer Vision and Machine Learning: Diff-CVML]()
* Traditional machine learning, pattern recognition and data analysis methods often assume that input data can be represented well by elements of Euclidean space. While this assumption has worked well for many past applications, researchers have increasingly realized that most data in vision and pattern recognition is intrinsically non-Euclidean, i.e. standard Euclidean calculus does not apply. The exploitation of this geometrical information can lead to more accurate representation the inherent structure of the data, better algorithms and better performance in practical applications. In particular, Riemannian geometric principles can be applied to a variety of difficult computer vision problems including face recognition, activity recognition, object detection, biomedical image analysis, and structure-from-motion, to name a few. Consequently, Riemannian geometric computing has become increasingly popular in the computer vision community. Besides nice mathematical formulations, Riemannian computations based on the geometry of underlying manifolds are often faster and more stable than their classical, Euclidean counterparts.

* This workshop will emphasize future directions beyond supervised learning such as reinforcement learning and weakly supervised learning. Such approaches require far less supervision and allow computers to learn beyond mimicking what is explicitly encoded in a large-scale set of annotations.
We are soliciting original contributions that address a wide range of theoretical and practical issues including, but not limited to:
<br>
  * Learning with limited data, trends and training strategies
  * Unsupervised learning
  * Transfer learning and domain transfer
  * Large scale image and video understanding
